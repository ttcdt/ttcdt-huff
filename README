ttcdt-huff - Huffman encoding library
=====================================

This code is my own implementation of the Huffman encoding
algorithm. Though it has been written for teaching purposes,
it's reasonably optimized for real use cases.

A command-line tool is provided with this library; there are
many fields of improvement on it. Mostly, it reads the file
to be compressed or decompressed as one big chunk, which may
not be the best idea. Not only because of the memory usage;
reading smaller blocks of data may increase the difference
in frequency usage of the bytes in the content, which is
where the Huffman algorithm benefits.

This software is released into the public domain.
